In this stage of the project I'm using a local structure of what mongoDB couuld look like.
Later on I'll connect this application with mongoDB and its cloud implementation.
However, since I'm using a local document I need to generate an id for all elements in the document.
ID in mongoDB is automatically generated, so in a later stage I have to amend the file by deleting the ID key.
