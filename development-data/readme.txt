In this initial stage of the project I'm using a local structure of what mongoDB could look like.
Later on I'll connect this application with mongoDB.
However, since I'm using a local document I need to generate an id for all elements in the document.
ID in mongoDB is automatically generated, so in a later stage I have to amend the file by deleting the ID key.

Tours-example.json has all the relative data for polulate the database.
a fuction seed will be called before lunching the application.
All data represented are dummy data that I have generated.
